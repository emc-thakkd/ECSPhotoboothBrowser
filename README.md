photobooth
======================
Photobooth is exactly what you think it is, it's an application to run a photobooth! This application was/is/will be used at EMC World 2015 in the EMC {code} booth. 

## Description
The photobooth uses the following technologies:
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express.js w/ Jade Templating
- AJAX
- jQuery
- S3 (can be AWS or ECS)
- Twitter API
- SMTP
- and more...

The photobooth has a 2 Station system to it. The first station is used for registration where users can enter their information to put their names in the queue. The second station is the actual photobooth itself where a user chooses their name to begin taking photos. There is an additional Admin dashboard where you have the ability to delete and edit objects as well as see some basic statistics

## Installation
There are a few methods to running this photobooth. You can run it locally on your laptop for development purposes, you can run it on a server, or run it on a PaaS of your choice. The `manifest.yml` is included for Cloud Foundry deployments

1. For Local Desktop or Server configurations
    1. Copy this repo
    2. create a mongoDB instance called `emcphotobooth` or change the instance name and location in `/model/db.js`.
    3. create a new file called `creds.json` and store the following credentails for environment variables:
        ```{ 
            "S3accessKeyId": "something...",
            "S3secretAccessKey": "something...",
            "S3endpoint": "",
            "S3url" : "something...",
            "smtpHost" : "something...",
            "smtpUN" : "something...",
            "smtpPW" : "something..."
        }```
    4. Run `npm install` within the photobooth directory to install all the neccesary modules from `package.json`
    5. Start the application with `npm start`
    6. Start Google Chrome with the appended flag `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`. This allows Chrome to access the Webcam & Audio without requiring the user to click Allow.
        - Mac: `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`
        - Windows: `start chrome --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`
        - GNU/Linux: `google-chrome --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` 
    7. For the Registration Kiosk, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (substitute 127 for your IP/DNS)
    8. For the Photobooth, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/infophotos/list` (substitute 127 for your IP/DNS)
